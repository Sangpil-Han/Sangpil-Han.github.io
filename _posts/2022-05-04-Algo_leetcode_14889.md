It's really hard for me.

Problem solving like this
1) make possible all teams 
2) get diff between team1 and team2


```python

## Take Time 2H
## Time complexity
N = int(input())
S = []
for i in range(N):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S += [a]

num = N//2
temp = [i for i in range(N)]
from itertools import combinations as c
## 1. make possible team
all_team = []
for i in c(temp, num):
    all_team += [i]

## 2. Get Diff between team1 and team2
# print(all_team)
min_val = 10**12
for i in range(len(all_team)):
    
    # get sum for team 1
    team1 = all_team[i] # [1,3,6]
    stat_a = 0
    for j in team1:
        for k in team1:
            stat_a += S[j][k]
    
    
    # get sum for team 2
    team2 = all_team[-i-1]
    stat_b = 0
    for j in team2:
        for k in team2:
            stat_b += S[j][k]
    
    min_val = min(min_val, abs(stat_a - stat_b))

print(min_val)     
```
